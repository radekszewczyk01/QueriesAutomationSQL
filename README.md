Streamline database queries with ease using a simple program leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities. Automate complex searches across numerous tables, simplifying data extraction for efficient response handling to co-workers requests.

### Usage
Imagine a scenario where a colleague at work asks you to compile several columns (parameters) from tables scattered throughout a large database. Typically, this process could be time-consuming, but with the assistance of artificial intelligence, it can be significantly streamlined.

`Example Scenario`:

Your colleague approaches you with a request to gather sales data from various tables across the company's database. They need to compile information such as sales amount, customer names, and product IDs from multiple tables that store transactional data.

`Example Query`:

"Could you please provide me with a report showing the total sales amount, customer names, and product IDs for all transactions from last month?"

Using the AI-powered program, you can quickly formulate and execute a query that retrieves the required columns from each relevant table, consolidating the information into a comprehensive report. This efficient approach saves time and enhances productivity in handling complex data requests within the organization.
